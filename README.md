The goal here is to implement an App to lets a user to study collections of flashcards.

It was tested on IOS Simulator and using Expo App on my Oneplus 7 that runs Android.

The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", 
add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
